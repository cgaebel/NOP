       HEADER                    PAYLOAD
[ A ][ B ][ C ][ D ]	[ E ][F][   ... G ...   ]

A
==
Version information.
0x0A for encryption/decryption key
0x64 for decrypted
0x65 for encrypted
TODO: Check veldi for encryption/decryption algorithm.

B
==
The size of the packet.
NOTE: This includes the size of the header.

C
==
The packet's checksum.
Set to zero, build the rest of the packet, then run the entire packet through the checksum algorithm.

D
==
The size of the packet's payload.
NOTE: Does NOT include the size of the header.

E
==
The command ID. Excellent for logging! See "Dexgod Command Dump.txt"

F
==
The packet ID.
Starts at zero and is incremented every time a packet is sent.
Used to verify packet integrity.
IDEA: When sending packets in the hooked send and recv functions, keep a private packetID and add
	  the two together whenever a packet is sent. It starts at zero and is incremented every time a
	  packet is sent.

G
==
D-sizeof(E)-sizeof(F) bytes long.
The parameters to the command.
